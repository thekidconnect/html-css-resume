						<li>
							<b>Worked primarily under Director of Data Science Dave Herman, with time under Principal Data Scientist Tittu Thomas</b>
						</li>
						<li>
							Staged gradient-boosted tree model to identify the best new locations to place vehicles to ride, building an interactive map-based Tableau product on top. Viewed by downstream stakeholders over 400 times in 6 months, it projected a 67% lift in utilization compared to new locations selected manually by Operations and general management
						</li>
						<li>
							Developed an exponential smoothing-based model for hourly opening of locations to release vehicles. This model achieved the same error as the principal scientist’s incumbent model, but ran weekly instead of hourly, saving 99.4% in compute resources
						</li>
						<li>
							Conducted exploratory analysis identifying opportunity 46% lift in time vehicles spent between getting damaged by conducting preemptive repairs during vehicle’s first repair session, leading to preemptive repair as a primary focus of the company’s 2020 vehicle maintenance strategy

							Internally building Cloudchaser, which does unsupervised learning on the social graph to deliver the web’s first open-source, human-centered, spatial content discovery tool. Mined over 600K social media profiles into a graph database using Python, neo4j, and APIs for popular UGC networks like Soundcloud. Implemented a PageRank algorithm for web profiles, which produces the ten highest-ranked artists out of clusters of ~20,000 in ~10 minutes on a local machine.
